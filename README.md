## Hello World Example

### Project Layout

```
node_modules/
public/
src/
  App.js
  index.css
  index.js
  registerServiceWorker.js
package.json
README.md
```

### Index.js

This is what "mounts our React application to the DOM. It uses an ID, `#root` on an element that you can find in `public/index.html`.

### App.js

This is the "component" that gets mounted inside of `index.js`. This is going to be our entrypoint for our application that everything else will extend off of.

### JSX

React does not use standard HTML, it uses something called JSX. It may seem a bit weird at first, but you will get the hang of it quickly.
